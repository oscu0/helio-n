<INSTRUCTIONS>
- Treat notebooks (.ipynb) as first-class source; include them when scanning/reading the repo or searching for code.
- Reading notebooks: read the raw .ipynb; do not run nbconvert just to read.
- Editing notebooks: ask me how you should proceed; if I do not specify, default to editing the raw .ipynb.
- If you want to make an optimization that short-circuits or bypasses existing functions (e.g., avoiding a function call), ask for my explicit consent first.
- Preface your commits with "Codex: " or "Copilot: "
- Always put imports at the top of the file or in the cell at the top of the notebook with imports
- DO NOT add exception handling (try-except) unless I explicitly request it. Let errors fail loud. This is a research codebase where silent failures mask bugs.
