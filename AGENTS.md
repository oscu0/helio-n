<INSTRUCTIONS>
- Treat notebooks (.ipynb) as first-class source; include them when scanning/reading the repo or searching for code.
- Reading notebooks: read the raw .ipynb; do not run nbconvert just to read.
- Editing notebooks: ask me how you should proceed; if I do not specify, default to editing the raw .ipynb.
- If you want to make an optimization that short-circuits or bypasses existing functions (e.g., avoiding a function call), ask for my explicit consent first.
